## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

Bootstrap is a powerful and flexible CSS framework for styling purposes. In this project I was using this useful tool; from the main container, through the style of the texts, to the style of the buttons. It took me a while to write all this, but as I practice with it, it will become easier and easier for me.

```html
<div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3">
  <button id="proceed" class="btn text-center fw-bold p-2 rounded-3 shadow">Proceed to Payment</button>
  <button id="cancell" class="btn text-center fw-bold p-2">Cancel Order</button>
</div>
```
